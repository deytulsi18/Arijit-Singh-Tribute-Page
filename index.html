                about
                music" and his parents decided to train him professionally. He was taught Indian classical music by
                Rajendra
                Prasad Hazari and trained in tabla by Dhirendra Prasad Hazari. Birendra Prasad Hazari taught him
                Rabindra

            <p class="para">Singh's musical career began when his guru Rajendra Prasad Hazari, who felt that "Indian
                classical music was
                a
                dying tradition", insisted him to leave his hometown and participate in the reality show Fame Gurukul
                (2005)
                at
                the age of 18. He was eliminated by audience polling, finishing in sixth place.</p>
            <p class="para">During the show, filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali recognized his talent and had him sing "Yun
                Shabnami" a song
                scheduled to be used in his upcoming film Saawariya. During production, the script changed and the song
                was
                no
                longer required. It was never released. After the Fame Gurukul, Kumar Taurani, the head of Tips, signed
                him
                for
                an album which was never released. </p>
            <p class="para">He participated in another reality show 10 Ke 10 Le Gaye Dil and won. He chose to move to
                Mumbai
                in 2006 to
                freelance, staying in a rented room in the Lokhandwala area of the city. He invested the prize money of
                ₹10
                Lakh
                from 10 ke 10 Le Gaye Dil to build his recording studio. He became a music producer and began composing
                music
                and singing pieces for advertisements, news channels and radio stations.</p>
            <p class="para">Singh spent a part of his early musical career as a music programmer and music producer for
                music directors
                such
                as Shankar-Ehsaan-Loy, Vishal-Shekhar, Mithoon, Monty Sharma and Pritam. While working with other
                composers
                he
                supervised the vocals, and the chorus sections, but it was while working with Pritam, that he began to
                produce
                and program music by himself.</p>
